# Machine-Learning-Projects

A collection of machine learning-based projects I have done in my leisure. The code are all in Python and the files are all Jupyter notebooks. A synposis of each project can be found below.

<h1>Brain Tumour Detection</h1>
This project aims to develop a binary image classification model to detect brain tumors in MRI images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning, this project seeks to automate the detection process, which can assist radiologists in diagnosing brain tumors more efficiently and accurately. By using a convolutional neural network (CNN), I was also to get the model to a 96.67% accuracy.<br><br>

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection), whereas the best model I achieved could not be uploaded as the file size was too big for Github
