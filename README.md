# Machine-Learning-Projects

A collection of machine learning-based projects I have done in my leisure. The code are all in Python and the files are all Jupyter notebooks. A synposis of each project can be found below.

<h1>Brain Tumour Detection</h1>
This project aims to develop a binary image classification model to detect brain tumors in MRI images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning, this project seeks to automate the detection process, which can assist radiologists in diagnosing brain tumors more efficiently and accurately. By using a convolutional neural network (CNN), I was also to get the model to a 96.67% accuracy.<br><br>

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection), whereas the best model I achieved could not be uploaded as the file size was too big for Github

<h1>Fruit Image Classification</h1>
This project aims to build a multiclass image classification model to identify various types of fruits from images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques, the project focuses on automating fruit recognition, which can be applied in areas such as inventory management and dietary applications. By preprocessing the data and training a CNN, the model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between different fruit categories, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in image-based classification tasks.<br><br>
The dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CGiAWso43GCsNo_faRq4jdDIlmwy7YI4/view), whereas the best model I achieved could not be uploaded as the file size was too big for Github<br><br>
Limitation of this project: The entire dataset consists of images containing <b>ONLY ONE</b> fruit each. This improvement can be found by using computer vision techniques such as YOLOv8
